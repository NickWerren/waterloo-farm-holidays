## Hidden Valley Discovery Park

A family discovery park set around lakes and woodland in a peaceful valley. Children can explore hedge mazes, adventure playgrounds, nature trails and pedal boats on the lake. There are also small animals to meet including goats, rabbits and chickens, plus a fossil hunting area and den-building zone in the woods.

The park has a relaxed feel -- less theme park, more outdoor adventure. It works well for families who want their children running around outside rather than queuing for rides. The lakeside cafe is decent for lunch. Allow half a day, or a full day if the weather is good and children want to explore everything.

**Parking:** Free on-site parking
**Cost:** Paid admission; under 2s free
**Best for:** Families with children aged 3-10, outdoor play, a quieter alternative to theme parks
