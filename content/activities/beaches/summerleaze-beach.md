## Summerleaze Beach

**Distance:** 30 minutes (15 miles) | **Type:** Sandy Beach with Sea Pool

Bude's main town beach, best known for its unique semi-natural tidal swimming pool - a highlight for visitors of all ages.

### Beach Overview

Summerleaze is a beautiful sandy beach right at the heart of Bude, easily reached on foot from the town centre. The beach is sheltered by a large breakwater and backed by grassy downs, giving it a slightly more sheltered feel than the exposed beaches further south. The real draw here is the Bude Sea Pool, a large semi-natural tidal pool carved into the rocks at the south end of the beach, which fills with clean seawater at each high tide and provides safe, calm swimming.

- **Lifeguards:** RNLI lifeguarded during summer season
- **Toilets:** Yes, at the beach and in town

### Best For
