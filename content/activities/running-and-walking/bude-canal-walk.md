## Bude Canal Walk

**Distance:** 4 miles (return) | **Type:** Linear (out and back)

A gentle, level walk along the historic Bude Canal from the sea lock in Bude to the pretty village of Marhamchurch and back. One of the easiest and most relaxing walks in the area, suitable for all ages.

### Route Overview

The Bude Canal was built in the 1820s to carry lime-rich sand inland to fertilise the acidic farmland of North Cornwall and Devon. Today the towpath makes for a lovely flat walk through peaceful countryside, following the canal as it winds past meadows, woodland and quiet farmland. The route is fully surfaced and pushchair-friendly for most of its length.

### Highlights

- The sea lock and lower canal basin in Bude, where the canal meets the harbour
- Historic lock gates and the restored sections of the canal
- Rich wildlife along the waterway, including kingfishers, herons, moorhens and dragonflies
- Peaceful views across open countryside toward Marhamchurch
- The pretty village of Marhamchurch with its ancient church and welcoming pub
- Wildflower meadows along the canal banks in spring and summer

### Route Details

**Starting Point:** Bude Canal basin, near the sea lock (parking available at Bude town car parks)
**Terrain:** Flat, surfaced towpath throughout. Some sections can be muddy after heavy rain.
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 to 2 hours at a relaxed pace

### What to Bring
