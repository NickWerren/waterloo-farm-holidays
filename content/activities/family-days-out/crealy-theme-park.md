## Crealy Theme Park

Devon's largest family theme park with over 60 rides and attractions spread across a large site. Roller coasters and thrill rides for older children sit alongside gentler rides, soft play areas and an animal zone for younger ones. The Tidal Wave water ride and Vortex roller coaster are popular with older kids.

There is also an indoor play area, which makes it a reasonable option in mixed weather. A farmyard section with goats, ponies and small animals gives younger children a break from rides. Food outlets are available on-site, though bringing a picnic can save a fair amount. Allow a full day.
