## Liskeard Lights Up

Liskeard's annual Christmas lights switch-on celebration. Daytime Christmas craft fairs and a family Cornish Christmas trail lead into an evening lantern parade — the Cavalcade of Nonsense — followed by the tree lights switch-on and a fireworks display. A lovely start to the festive season.

**Date:** Late November 2026 (TBC — usually last Saturday in November)
**Location:** Liskeard town centre
**Type:** Seasonal celebration
