## Trethorne Leisure Park

A popular indoor leisure park just outside Launceston, making it one of the closest family attractions to Waterloo Farm. The main draws are ten-pin bowling, a large soft play area for younger children, and indoor go-karting. There is also a small animal park with donkeys, goats, ponies and rabbits, plus outdoor play equipment.

Trethorne is ideal for rainy days -- almost everything is under cover. The bowling lanes and soft play are good for a couple of hours, and the on-site restaurant serves standard family fare. It tends to get busy during school holidays, so arriving earlier in the day is advisable.

**Location:** Kennards House, near Launceston -- approximately 5 miles from Waterloo Farm
**Parking:** Free on-site parking
**Cost:** Pay per activity (bowling, soft play, karting priced separately)
**Best for:** Rainy days, families with mixed ages, a quick half-day outing close to base
