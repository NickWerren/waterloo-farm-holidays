## Pennywell Farm

A hands-on farm park in South Devon, well known for its miniature pigs which children can hold and cuddle during daily handling sessions. Throughout the day there is a packed timetable of activities: ferret racing, pony rides, bottle-feeding lambs in season, tractor rides and falconry displays.

The farm has indoor and outdoor play areas, and enough scheduled activities to fill a full day easily. It is a genuinely interactive experience -- children are encouraged to touch, hold and feed the animals throughout. The drive from Waterloo Farm crosses Dartmoor, which is scenic in its own right.
