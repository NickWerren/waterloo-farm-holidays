Two of our cottages are pet friendly:

- **The Old Apple Tallet** — one dog welcome
- **Swallow Barn** — one dog welcome (low season weeks)

The charge is **£20 per week per dog**.

The remaining four cottages (Saffron Cottage, Haypole Barn, Kingfisher Cottage, and Sandmartins) are dog-free to ensure they remain suitable for guests with allergies.
