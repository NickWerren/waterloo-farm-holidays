Three of our cottages have accessible ground-floor accommodation:

- **Haypole Barn** — wheelchair accessible
- **Kingfisher Cottage** — wheelchair accessible
- **Sandmartins** — ground-floor double bedroom with en suite wet room, suitable for those with mobility problems

**Shower chairs** can be reserved at the time of booking for use in Kingfisher Cottage, Haypole Barn, or Sandmartins.

Sandmartins and Haypole Barn can be linked through on the ground floor to create a 16-person holiday barn — ideal for larger groups with mixed accessibility needs.
