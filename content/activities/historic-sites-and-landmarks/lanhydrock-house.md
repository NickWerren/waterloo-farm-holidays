## Lanhydrock House

One of Cornwall's grandest country houses, set in magnificent grounds above the River Fowey near Bodmin. The house dates from the 17th century but was largely rebuilt after a devastating fire in 1881. The result is a fascinating snapshot of High Victorian life, with over 50 rooms open to visitors, including kitchens, servants' quarters, nurseries, and the remarkable Long Gallery with its original 17th-century plaster ceiling.

The gardens include formal Victorian parterres, a woodland garden noted for magnolias and rhododendrons, and an extensive parkland ideal for walking. The estate also has waymarked cycling trails through the surrounding woods.
