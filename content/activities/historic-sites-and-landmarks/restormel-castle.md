## Restormel Castle

One of the best-preserved circular shell keeps in England, sitting on a hilltop surrounded by deep woodland above the River Fowey. Built in the late 13th century, the castle's walls survive almost to their full height, giving a strong impression of the original layout including the great hall, kitchens, solar, and chapel.

Restormel is a quieter, less crowded alternative to some of Cornwall's more famous castles, and the peaceful woodland setting makes it a pleasant short visit. The Black Prince held the castle in the 14th century as part of the Duchy of Cornwall. A short walk from the car park leads up through the trees to the entrance.
