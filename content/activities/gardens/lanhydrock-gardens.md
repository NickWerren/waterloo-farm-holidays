## Lanhydrock Gardens

The gardens at Lanhydrock are among the finest in Cornwall, surrounding the grand Victorian house managed by the National Trust. While the house is well worth visiting in its own right (see our [Historic Sites](/activities/historic-sites-and-landmarks/lanhydrock-house/) page), the gardens and grounds alone justify the trip. Formal parterre gardens with clipped box hedging sit near the house, while the higher garden above is planted with outstanding collections of magnolias, camellias and rhododendrons.

Spring is particularly spectacular, when the magnolias and camellias are in full flower and bluebells carpet the surrounding woodland. Woodland walks extend through the wider estate along the River Fowey, and there are also waymarked cycling trails for those who bring bikes. The gardens and grounds are open year-round, even when the house is closed for the season. Allow two to three hours for the gardens, or a full day if combining with the house.
