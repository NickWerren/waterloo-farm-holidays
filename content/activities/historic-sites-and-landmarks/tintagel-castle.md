## Tintagel Castle

Spectacular clifftop ruins perched on a headland above the Atlantic, famously linked to the legend of King Arthur. The site has been occupied since the Roman period, with substantial remains from a medieval castle built by Richard, Earl of Cornwall in the 1230s. Archaeological excavations have also uncovered evidence of a high-status settlement from the 5th and 6th centuries.

A modern footbridge now connects the mainland to the headland, replacing the original medieval approach. The walk involves steep steps and uneven ground, so sturdy footwear is recommended. Merlin's Cave can be viewed from the beach below at low tide.
