## Bird Watching in Cornwall

Cornwall's diverse habitats offer exceptional bird watching opportunities year-round. From coastal seabirds to moorland species, discover the best spots for observing wildlife near Waterloo Farm.

### Premier Reserves

The RSPB manage two reserves in Cornwall - **Marazion Marsh**, their most southerly reserve, and **Hayle Estuary**, the UK's most southerly estuary and one of the few that never freezes. These sites provide crucial habitat for wintering waders, waterfowl, and migrating birds.

In addition to these, countless local nature reserves and bird sanctuaries offer peaceful feeding and breeding grounds to rare and scarce birds, such as the uninhabited island of Annet on Scilly, home to one of Britain's last remaining Puffin colonies.

### Estuaries & Coastal Habitat

Drowned river valleys such as **Helford** and the **Carrick Roads** near Falmouth offer migrating waders a much-needed chance to rest and re-fuel. Offshore rocks and reefs such as Lye Rock near Tintagel provide important breeding grounds for many species of seabird.

Still relatively under-watched, especially in sparsely populated places such as the Rame Peninsula, Cornwall offers unrivalled scenery for birders with access via the South West Coast Path to even the most desolate spot.

### The Isles of Scilly

The Isles of Scilly, with their lack of traffic and unchanging natural environment, offer a once in a lifetime experience to anyone with even a passing interest in wildlife. The islands are renowned for rare vagrant birds and spectacular seabird colonies.
