## Cotehele House

Remarkably well-preserved medieval manor house tucked into the steep, wooded slopes of the Tamar Valley. Built between 1300 and 1627 by the Edgcumbe family, the house is one of the least altered medieval houses in the country. The interiors are lit naturally rather than by electric light, with rooms filled with tapestries, armour, and original furniture.

Beyond the house, the estate includes terraced gardens dropping down to the river, a medieval dovecote, a working watermill producing stoneground flour, and Cotehele Quay with a small maritime museum and the restored Tamar sailing barge Shamrock. The surrounding woods are excellent for walking, particularly in spring when the bluebells and wild garlic are out.
