## Roadford Lake

**Distance:** 4 miles | **Type:** Circular

A gentle circular walk around Devon's largest reservoir, set in rolling countryside with superb birdwatching and beautiful reflections on calm days. An easy, family-friendly route.

### Route Overview

Roadford Lake was created in 1989 when the Wolf valley was dammed to provide water for much of Devon and Cornwall. The reservoir holds over 34,000 million litres and has since become an important site for wildlife, particularly migrating birds. The circular walk follows well-maintained paths and tracks around the lake, offering constantly changing views across the water and surrounding hills.

### Highlights

- Panoramic views across Devon's largest lake from several vantage points
- Excellent birdwatching, with osprey regularly spotted during spring and autumn migration
- Wintering wildfowl including teal, wigeon and goldeneye
- Beautiful reflections of the surrounding hills on still mornings
- The dam itself, an impressive feat of engineering with views along the lake
- A welcoming cafe at the dam end for refreshments before or after your walk

### Route Details

**Starting Point:** Roadford Lake car park, near the dam (PL16 0JL)
**Terrain:** Mostly flat, well-maintained paths and farm tracks. Some sections can be muddy after rain.
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 to 2 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy. Suitable for families and older children. Some sections may be uneven underfoot but the route is largely accessible.

### What to Bring

- Comfortable walking shoes or light boots
- Binoculars for birdwatching (essential in spring and autumn for osprey)

- A picnic to enjoy at one of the lakeside spots, or plan to stop at the cafe
