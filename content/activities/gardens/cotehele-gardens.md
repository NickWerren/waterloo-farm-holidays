## Cotehele Gardens

One of the most atmospheric estates in the South West, Cotehele is a remarkably well-preserved medieval manor house set in terraced gardens that drop steeply through woodland to the River Tamar. Managed by the National Trust, the gardens have been developed over centuries and offer a wonderful mix of formal terraces near the house, a medieval stewpond, and a richly planted Valley Garden filled with exotic specimens that thrive in the sheltered riverside microclimate.

Spring is the standout season, when daffodils and tulips fill the upper terraces and magnolias and camellias flower in the valley below, though autumn colour along the Tamar is equally rewarding. Down at the river you will find Cotehele Quay, a beautifully restored wharf with a small maritime museum and the Shamrock, the last surviving Tamar sailing barge. A working watermill nearby produces stoneground flour that you can buy to take home. Allow a half day for the gardens, quay and mill, or a full day if you add the house.
