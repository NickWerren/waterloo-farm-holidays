## The Eden Project

Two enormous biomes built in a reclaimed clay pit housing tropical rainforest and Mediterranean environments. The Rainforest Biome is the world's largest indoor rainforest, warm and humid with towering trees, waterfalls and rope bridges. The Mediterranean Biome covers plants from South Africa, California and the Med. Outside, extensive gardens cover the Cornish landscape with native and global plantings.

Beyond the biomes, there are seasonal exhibitions, zip wires, ice skating in winter, and regular storytelling and craft sessions for younger children. The whole site is pushchair-friendly, though some paths are steep. Allow at least half a day.
