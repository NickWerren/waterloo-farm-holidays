## Fishing in Cornwall

Cornwall is renowned as one of the UK's premier fishing destinations, offering exceptional diversity for all angling disciplines. From world-class sea fishing along dramatic coastlines to tranquil freshwater lakes and challenging fly fishing venues, the county provides year-round opportunities for anglers of all abilities.

### Sea Fishing

Cornwall's extensive coastline offers outstanding sea fishing opportunities, with the rugged North coast and sheltered South coast providing distinctly different experiences.

**North Coast** - Known for its dramatic cliffs and powerful Atlantic swells, the North coast is ideal for experienced anglers targeting bass, pollack, and mackerel from rocks and beaches. Popular marks include Bude, Padstow, and Newquay.

**South Coast** - The more sheltered southern waters offer family-friendly beach fishing and excellent boat angling. Target species include bass, rays, smoothhound, and various flatfish. Key locations include Falmouth, Fowey, and Looe.

**Boat Fishing** - Charter boats operate from major ports including Padstow, Newquay, Falmouth, and Looe, offering trips for reef species, shark fishing, and bottom fishing for conger, ling, and pollack.

### Freshwater & Coarse Fishing

Cornwall's rivers, lakes, and purpose-built fisheries provide excellent coarse fishing throughout the year.

**River Fowey** - One of Cornwall's premier river systems, offering quality roach, dace, and chub fishing. The tidal reaches hold mullet and bass.

**Bodmin Moor Waters** - Including Colliford Lake and Siblyback Lake, these upland waters offer excellent trout fishing and coarse fishing in stunning moorland settings.

**Commercial Fisheries** - Well-stocked day ticket venues including Bake Fishing Lakes, Gwinear Lakes, and Meadow Lakes offer consistent sport for carp, tench, and silverfish.

### Fly Fishing

Cornwall's fly fishing venues range from wild moorland reservoirs to specialist stillwater fisheries.

**Reservoir Fishing** - Colliford Lake and Siblyback Reservoir on Bodmin Moor offer challenging wild brown trout and stocked rainbow trout fishing in spectacular settings.

**Specialist Venues** - Innis Fly Fishery near Bodmin provides quality stillwater fly fishing for rainbow and brown trout in a more intimate setting.

### Carp Fishing

Dedicated carp anglers will find several well-maintained venues offering quality fishing for specimens.

**Lower Tamar Lake** - A popular venue on the Devon-Cornwall border known for quality carp to over 20lb in a beautiful setting.

**Oakside Fishery** - Purpose-built carp lakes offering excellent facilities and quality fish in a peaceful environment.

**Meadow Lakes** - Well-stocked commercial fishery with multiple lakes catering to both pleasure anglers and specimen hunters.

### Permits & Regulations

Most commercial fisheries operate on a day ticket basis. River fishing may require Environment Agency rod licenses and additional permits from local angling clubs. Sea fishing from shore requires no license, though boat charters are fully licensed. Always check local bylaws and follow the Angling Trust's code of conduct.
