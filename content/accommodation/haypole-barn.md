## Welcome to Haypole Barn

Haypole Barn is our largest holiday barn, full of charm with deep squishy leather sofas, warm rugs on the slate floor underfoot and a genuine cartwheel (once used on this farm) forming a rustic chandelier overhead.

The inspiration for the name is the Hay Pole, now a decoration in the living room, but once used by Great Grandfather to lift hay to the top of the rick in the farm yard in days of old.

In the well equipped country kitchen you will find everything needed to cater for a holiday, including a gas fired Rayburn and separate hob and an American style fridge freezer.

This cottage has a minstrels gallery and secret windows looking down on the living room which children love to peek through.

### Bedrooms

There are 4 bedrooms:

- **Upstairs:** Two bedrooms with king sized beds and en suite shower rooms, plus a bunks room with nearby bathroom
- **Downstairs:** Large bedroom with twin beds and en suite wet room, also suitable for those with mobility problems, including wheelchair users

### Outside

Meals outside and barbecues are an enjoyable part of any holiday and the patio with views across the valley is ideally equipped for this purpose.

### Large Groups

This cottage can be opened up on the ground floor to link through to Sandmartins next door, creating a 16 person holiday barn - perfect for retreats, activity courses, and family gatherings.
