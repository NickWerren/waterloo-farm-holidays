## Constantine Bay

**Distance:** 45 minutes (30 miles) | **Level:** Intermediate to Advanced | **Type:** Sandy Beach Break

One of North Cornwall's most consistent surf beaches, delivering quality waves that reward experienced surfers.

### Beach Overview

Constantine Bay is a wide, sandy beach on the exposed north coast near Padstow. It picks up virtually every Atlantic swell going, which means there are almost always waves here. The trade-off is power -- on bigger days, the surf can be strong and fast, making it better suited to confident intermediates and advanced surfers. The beach is backed by dunes and a golf course, giving it a wilder feel than the more developed spots.

### Surf Conditions

- **Best Tide:** All tides, but best at mid to low
- **Swell Direction:** W to NW (very exposed, catches everything)
- **Wave Type:** Powerful, well-shaped beach breaks
- **Bottom:** Sand
- **Crowding:** Popular with experienced surfers; busy on good days

### Facilities

- **Parking:** National Trust car park behind the dunes
- **Lifeguards:** RNLI lifeguards May to September
- **Surf Hire:** Constantine Bay Surf School on site
- **Toilets:** Yes, at the car park
- **Nearby:** Padstow is 10 minutes by car for restaurants and shops

### Best For

- **Intermediates:** Clean, well-shaped waves on moderate days
- **Advanced Surfers:** Powerful and hollow on bigger swells
- **Consistency:** Almost always has rideable waves

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Take the A395 to the A39 towards Camelford, then the A389 towards Padstow. Turn off at St Merryn and follow signs to Constantine Bay. Around 45 minutes.

**The furthest of our recommended surf spots but well worth the drive for quality, consistent waves. Combine it with lunch in nearby Padstow for a memorable day out on the North Cornwall coast.**
