## Cycling in Cornwall

Cornwall offers exceptional cycling for all abilities, from leisurely coastal paths to challenging moorland climbs. The county's diverse terrain, quiet lanes, and stunning scenery make it a premier cycling destination in the UK.

### Road Cycling

Cornwall's network of quiet country lanes provides excellent road cycling opportunities. Routes range from gentle coastal rides to challenging climbs across Bodmin Moor. Spring and autumn offer ideal conditions with lighter traffic and comfortable temperatures.

**Coast Roads** - The coastal B-roads offer spectacular sea views and generally gentle gradients. Popular routes include the north coast road through picturesque fishing villages and the south coast between historic ports.

**Moorland Routes** - Bodmin Moor provides serious climbing challenges with rewarding views. Expect steep gradients, exposed conditions, and dramatic landscapes.

**Country Lanes** - The network of single-track lanes offers peaceful cycling through traditional Cornish countryside. Narrow roads mean occasional passing places, but traffic is generally light.

### The Cornish Way - National Cycle Network

The Cornish Way is Cornwall's premier long-distance cycling route, forming part of the National Cycle Network. This 180-mile journey runs from Land's End to Bude on the Devon border, designed to avoid major roads while showcasing Cornwall's finest landscapes, historic towns, fishing villages, and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

**Two Alternative Routes:**
- **North Route** - Via Padstow on the North Cornish coast
- **South Route** - Via St Austell on the South coast

The route incorporates several established trails including the famous Camel Trail and the Engine House Trail, part of the Mineral Tramway Trails through Cornwall's historic mining heartland (a UNESCO World Heritage Site).

**Six Component Trails:**

1. **The First and Last Trail** (Land's End to Hayle) - Crosses rugged West Cornwall, passing ancient sites, Mousehole, Penzance, St Michael's Mount, and Marazion

2. **The Engine House Trail** (Hayle to Truro) - Through Cornwall's industrial heartland, incorporating the largely traffic-free Redruth & Chacewater Railway Trail amid old mine workings

3. **The Coast and Clay Trail** (Truro to Bodmin via St Austell) - Past Trelissick Gardens, across King Harry Ferry, along the coast via Portloe and Mevagissey, past Lost Gardens of Heligan, through China Clay Country to the Eden Project and Lanhydrock House

4. **The North Cornwall Trail** (Bodmin to Devon border) - Via Blisland on Bodmin Moor, through valleys and over exposed moorland to Bude

5. **The St Piran Trail** (Truro to Bodmin via Newquay) - Alternative route heading to the North Coast resort of Newquay, then inland to St Columb Major and Padstow before joining the Camel Trail

6. **The Camel Trail** (Padstow to Bodmin) - Cornwall's most famous traffic-free section, running 18 miles alongside the River Camel

While approximately 29 miles of the Cornish Way is traffic-free, much of the route follows quiet country lanes carefully selected to showcase Cornwall's diverse beauty while minimizing exposure to busy roads.

### Off-Road & Mountain Biking

**Trails** - Purpose-built mountain bike trails at venues like Cardinham Woods offer graded routes from family-friendly green trails to technical black runs.

**Bridleways** - An extensive bridleway network across moorland and countryside provides natural off-road riding with varied terrain and stunning views.

**Camel Trail** - Cornwall's most famous traffic-free route runs 18 miles from Padstow to Bodmin along a disused railway line. Flat, safe, and suitable for all abilities.

### Family Cycling

**Traffic-Free Routes** - The Camel Trail and coastal sections of the South West Coast Path offer safe, family-friendly cycling away from roads.

**Quiet Lanes** - Many rural areas have designated quiet lanes ideal for family rides. These routes minimize traffic and maximize scenery.

**Bike Hire** - Multiple locations offer bike hire including children's bikes, tag-alongs, and child seats, making family cycling accessible.

### Coastal Path Cycling

Certain sections of the South West Coast Path are open to cyclists, offering spectacular coastal scenery. These routes vary from easy coastal sections to challenging climbs. Always check access rights before setting out.

### Essential Information

**Weather** - Coastal areas can be exposed to strong winds. Moorland weather changes rapidly. Check forecasts and be prepared.

**Road Conditions** - Rural lanes can be narrow with limited passing places. Exercise caution and courtesy with other road users.

**Bike Shops** - Well-stocked bike shops in major towns offer repairs, spares, and local route advice.

**Cafés** - Cyclist-friendly cafés are common, particularly on popular routes. Many offer secure bike parking and welcome muddy cyclists.

### Safety & Courtesy

- Carry essential tools and spares - help can be far away
- Respect other road users on narrow lanes
- Give way to vehicles on single-track roads
- Follow the countryside code on off-road routes
- Be visible - lights and reflective clothing essential
- Check your bike before heading out

### Best Times to Ride

**Spring (March-May)** - Quieter roads, mild weather, wildflowers blooming

**Summer (June-August)** - Longest days but busiest roads, early starts recommended

**Autumn (September-November)** - Often the best weather, quieter roads, beautiful colours

**Winter** - Can be excellent on dry days, but expect mud on trails and shorter daylight hours
