Starting from Waterloo Farm, the route heads onto Bodmin Moor via quiet lanes, climbing steadily to cross the high moorland plateau. The route passes iconic moorland landmarks including Brown Willy (Cornwall's highest point), Rough Tor, and dramatic granite tors.

### Route Profile

### Weather Considerations

Bodmin Moor weather can be extreme and changes rapidly. What starts as a calm, sunny day at lower elevations can turn windy, wet, and cold on the moor. Essential precautions:

- Check detailed weather forecast before setting out
- Carry full waterproof clothing
- Bring warm layers (windproof jacket essential)
- Visibility can drop quickly in mist and fog
- Strong winds are common - exposed sections can be challenging
