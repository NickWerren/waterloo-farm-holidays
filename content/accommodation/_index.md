## Our Holiday Cottages

Each of the cottages has its own character and unique set of facilities, so whether you're a couple wanting to get away from it all for a winter weekend, a family looking for a fun fortnight's summer holiday or a celebration gathering of 16 friends or family, we have a cottage to suit your needs.

### Flexible & Accessible

The accommodation here is very flexible with **three of the cottages being wheelchair accessible** (Haypole Barn, Kingfisher Cottage, and Sandmartins).

Our two largest cottages, **Haypole Barn & Sandmartins**, can be opened up and used as one large venue for gatherings with plenty of space for 16 people, whether it be a family party or holiday, a peaceful venue for a Retreat or Activity Course, or just a great place to spend Christmas or New Year.

### Perfect Location

Only **6 miles from the market town of Launceston** and the A30, and **12 miles from the nearest beach** at Crackington Haven, Waterloo Farm is not only a great destination in itself, but also an excellent holiday base for visiting the wonderful beaches and rugged scenery of Cornwall or the towns and tors of Dartmoor.
