**Planning & Preparation:**
- Research your route thoroughly before setting out

- Strong winds are common on exposed moorland
- Bogs and marshes can be hazardous - stick to paths
- Moorland streams can rise rapidly after rain
- In poor visibility, use compass/GPS navigation

- Cliff edges can be unstable - stay on marked paths
- Never climb on cliffs or approach cliff edges

**Weather Awareness:**
