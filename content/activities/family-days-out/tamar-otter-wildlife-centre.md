## Tamar Otter & Wildlife Centre

A small, peaceful wildlife centre focused on British otters and native wildlife, set in the Tamar Valley just outside Launceston. The centre breeds Asian short-clawed otters and British otters, with regular feeding talks where you can watch them up close. There are also fallow deer, golden pheasants, owls and a variety of waterfowl.

The site is compact and manageable with young children -- a couple of hours is enough to see everything at a relaxed pace. Woodland walks around the grounds are pleasant and well-maintained. A good option for a shorter outing or a calm afternoon close to base.

**Location:** North Petherwin, Launceston -- approximately 3 miles from Waterloo Farm
**Parking:** Free on-site parking
**Cost:** Paid admission; check seasonal opening times as hours vary
**Best for:** Young children, animal lovers, a quieter day out
