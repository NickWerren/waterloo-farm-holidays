## Sandymouth Bay

**Distance:** 35 minutes (18 miles) | **Type:** Sandy Beach with Rock Formations

A quieter National Trust beach north of Bude, known for its striking folded and twisted rock formations and dog-friendly access all year round.

### Beach Overview

Sandymouth is a gem for those who prefer a less crowded beach. Managed by the National Trust, the bay sits beneath rugged cliffs and is renowned for its extraordinary geological features - layers of rock dramatically folded and contorted by ancient forces, creating a landscape that feels almost otherworldly. At low tide, a good stretch of sand is revealed, though the beach is rockier at high tide. It is dog-friendly throughout the year, making it a popular choice for walkers and dog owners.

### Facilities

- **Parking:** National Trust car park (free for members)
- **Lifeguards:** Not lifeguarded
- **Toilets:** Yes, at the car park
- **Cafe:** Seasonal National Trust cafe at the car park

### Best For

- **Dog Owners:** Dogs welcome all year round, with no seasonal restrictions
- **Geology & Scenery:** The twisted rock formations are genuinely spectacular and unlike anything on nearby beaches
- **Quieter Beach Days:** Less busy than Widemouth Bay and Summerleaze, especially outside peak summer

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Head north-west via the A395 and A39 towards Bude, then continue north on the coast road past Bude. Sandymouth is signposted from the A39 north of the town. Around 35 minutes.
