## Launceston Castle

Imposing Norman castle dominating the hilltop above Launceston. Built shortly after the Norman Conquest, it served as the administrative centre of Cornwall for centuries. The unusual shell keep sits on top of a high motte, giving commanding views over the town, Dartmoor, and Bodmin Moor.

The castle played a role in the English Civil War and was later used as a prison. George Fox, founder of the Quakers, was held here in 1656. The surrounding grounds are well maintained and make a pleasant spot to explore.
