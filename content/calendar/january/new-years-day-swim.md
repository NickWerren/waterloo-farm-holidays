## New Year's Day Swim

A longstanding Cornish tradition where hundreds of swimmers take to the icy January sea to ring in the new year. Organised swims take place at beaches across Cornwall including Newquay, Gyllyngvase Beach (Falmouth), and Gorran Haven, with informal dips at many more. A bracing and unforgettable way to start the year.
