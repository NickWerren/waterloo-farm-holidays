## RHS Garden Rosemoor

A Royal Horticultural Society garden set in 65 acres of rolling North Devon countryside near Great Torrington. Rosemoor offers an impressive range of themed gardens, from formal rose gardens and a cottage garden to a hot garden planted in vivid reds, oranges and yellows, and a winter garden designed to provide colour and interest in the colder months. The original garden, created by Lady Anne Palmer from the 1960s, sits alongside the newer RHS gardens and arboretum.

One of the closer garden options from Waterloo Farm, making it a good choice for a shorter outing. The plant centre is excellent and well worth browsing, and the cafe serves good food using local ingredients. The gardens are well maintained year-round, with each season offering something different. RHS members enter free, making it particularly good value for regular visitors. Allow two to three hours.

**Parking:** Free on-site car park
**Cost:** Paid admission; RHS members free. Under 5s free
**Best for:** Garden enthusiasts, a shorter day trip, plant shopping, all seasons
