## Bodmin & Wenford Railway

Cornwall's only full-size heritage railway runs steam and diesel trains along a scenic route between Bodmin General and Boscarne Junction, passing through woodland and the edge of Bodmin Moor. A return journey takes around an hour, and children love watching the locomotive being turned and coupled at each end.

The railway runs themed events throughout the year, including Santa Specials in December and Day Out With Thomas weekends. Bodmin General station has a small railway museum, cafe and gift shop. It pairs well with a visit to Bodmin town or nearby Lanhydrock House for a full day out.
