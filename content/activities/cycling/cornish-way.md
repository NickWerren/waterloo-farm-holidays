**Navigation:** The route is signed as part of the National Cycle Network (Route 3), but detailed maps or GPS are recommended, particularly on the quieter lane sections.

### Key Considerations

**Fitness Level:** While individual sections vary in difficulty, completing the full route requires good cycling fitness and stamina for multi-day riding.

**Weather:** Cornwall's weather can change rapidly. Be prepared for rain, wind, and sun, sometimes all in one day.

**Road Conditions:** Cornish lanes can be narrow with limited passing places. Exercise caution and courtesy with other road users.

**Services:** Major towns have bike shops for repairs and supplies. Some rural sections have limited services - plan accordingly.

**Season:** Spring (April-May) and autumn (September-October) often provide the best combination of weather and quieter roads. Summer is busiest but offers longest daylight hours.

### Safety Notes

- Let someone know your route and expected arrival times
- Carry sufficient food and water for longer sections
- Mobile signal can be limited in rural and moorland areas
- Be visible - lights essential for dawn/dusk riding and overcast conditions
- Check weather forecasts and be prepared to adjust plans
- Emergency services: Call 999 if needed
