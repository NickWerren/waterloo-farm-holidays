## Widemouth Bay

A broad, expansive sandy beach just south of Bude - one of the most popular family and surf beaches on the North Cornwall coast.

### Beach Overview

Widemouth Bay lives up to its name with a long, wide stretch of golden sand that offers plenty of space even on busy summer days. The beach faces west into the Atlantic, picking up good swells for surfing and bodyboarding, while the gently shelving sand makes it a safe and enjoyable spot for families with children. At low tide the beach is enormous, with firm sand ideal for games and sandcastle building.
