## Colliford Lake

Cornwall's largest lake, Colliford sits high on Bodmin Moor and offers spectacular fly fishing in a dramatic moorland setting. At over 900 acres, this reservoir provides challenging fishing for both wild brown trout and regularly stocked rainbow trout.

### Fishing Information

**Species:** Rainbow trout (stocked), wild brown trout
**Methods:** Fly fishing only
**Season:** March to October (check current dates)
**Day Tickets:** Available on site
**Facilities:** Parking, toilet facilities, boat hire available

### What to Expect

The lake is regularly stocked with rainbow trout averaging 1-2lb, with some specimens reaching much larger sizes. Wild brown trout provide an additional challenge for experienced anglers. The exposed moorland location means weather can change rapidly, and the lake can be challenging in windy conditions.

### Fishing Techniques

Both bank and boat fishing are available. Bank anglers often find success along the dam wall and in sheltered bays. Boat fishing allows access to deeper water and productive drifts across submerged features. Standard reservoir patterns work well - try buzzers, nymphs, and lures depending on conditions.

### Location & Access

Located on Bodmin Moor between Bodmin and Liskeard. Well signposted from the A30. The exposed location offers stunning views but be prepared for changeable weather typical of moorland environments.

### Top Tips

- Wind can be strong on the moor - bring warm, waterproof clothing
- Early and late season fishing can be particularly productive
- Buzzers and nymphs work well in calmer conditions
- Boat fishing increases your chances significantly
- Check water levels before visiting - drought conditions can affect fishing
