## The Coffee Post

A lovely little village cafe at Marshgate, right next to the post office and stores where you can pick up pottery, souvenirs, and groceries. A great spot for coffee and homemade cakes, and a proper local find rather than a tourist trap.

**Location:** Post Office And Stores, Marshgate, Camelford, PL32 9YN

**Specialties:** Homemade cakes, great coffee, local pottery and souvenirs next door
