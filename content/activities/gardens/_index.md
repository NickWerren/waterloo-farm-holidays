## Gardens

Cornwall and Devon are home to some of Britain's most remarkable gardens, thanks to a mild maritime climate that allows subtropical and exotic plants to thrive outdoors. From dramatic ravine gardens tumbling down to hidden beaches to carefully restored Victorian estates, there is enormous variety within easy reach of Waterloo Farm. Many gardens are beautiful year-round, with spring and early summer particularly rewarding.
