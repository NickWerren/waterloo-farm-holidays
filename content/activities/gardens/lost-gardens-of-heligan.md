## The Lost Gardens of Heligan

One of the most popular gardens in Cornwall and one of the most remarkable restoration stories in British horticulture. The gardens at Heligan were created by the Tremayne family over several centuries but fell into neglect after the First World War, when many of the estate's gardeners were lost. Rediscovered in 1990, the 200-acre site has been painstakingly restored and is now a rich mix of productive gardens, pleasure grounds and wild landscapes.

The Jungle garden is a highlight -- a steep-sided valley filled with giant tree ferns, bamboo, palms and a rope bridge across the canopy. The productive gardens are equally impressive, with restored pineapple pits, melon houses and Victorian glasshouses growing fruit and vegetables using traditional methods. There is also a wildlife project in the wider estate, with hides for watching birds and a programme of habitat restoration. Allow at least half a day.
