## Camel Creek Adventure Park

A family adventure park near Wadebridge with a mix of rides, water play and animal encounters. The Jurassic-themed dinosaur trail with life-size animatronic dinosaurs is a highlight for younger children. There are also pedal boats, a drop slide, go-karts and a number of gentler rides suited to under-10s.

Indoor play areas and a 4D cinema provide cover on wet days. The park also has meerkats, wallabies and other small animals. It is a smaller, less crowded alternative to the larger theme parks and well-suited to families with children under 10. A full day visit for younger children; half a day for older ones.
