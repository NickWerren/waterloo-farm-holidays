## Trebarwith Strand

**Distance:** 35 minutes (20 miles) | **Type:** Sandy Beach (Tide Dependent)

A spectacular beach tucked into a steep valley near Tintagel, revealing a huge expanse of sand at low tide. Check tide times before you visit.

### Beach Overview

Trebarwith Strand is one of North Cornwall's most dramatic beaches. Accessed down a narrow lane and a short walk through a valley, the beach is almost entirely covered at high tide but transforms at low tide into a vast stretch of golden sand backed by dark, towering cliffs. The setting is breathtaking. This is very much a tide-dependent beach, so checking tide times before your visit is essential - aim to arrive as the tide is going out for maximum beach time.

### Facilities

- **Parking:** Small car park at the top of the valley (limited spaces, arrives early in summer)
- **Lifeguards:** Not lifeguarded
- **Toilets:** Yes, near the car park
- **Cafe:** The Port William pub and a small cafe near the beach

### Best For

- **Scenery:** One of the most dramatic and photogenic beaches in Cornwall
- **Low Tide Exploring:** Huge sandy beach, caves and rock features to explore
- **Walkers:** Links to the South West Coast Path and close to Tintagel

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Head north-west via the B3254 and B3263 towards Boscastle, then follow the coast road south towards Tintagel. Trebarwith Strand is signposted off the B3263. Around 35 minutes.
