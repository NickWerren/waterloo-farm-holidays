## Welcome to Kingfisher Cottage

Another adaptable property, this cottage offers superb accommodation for up to 5 people.

The living area is open plan with a cheerful red gas Rayburn making the country style kitchen very welcoming, and of course there are all the other kitchen items you would expect to find as well, including a gas hob and microwave.

Country style furnishings, soft leather sofas, rugs on the polished wood floor, all arranged around a woodburner add up to the promise of cosy evenings in, whatever the season.

Being on one level, and with two entrances - one via steps through the small private garden and balcony and the other from a separate level parking area - Kingfisher Cottage is disabled friendly, including for wheelchairs.

### Bedrooms

- **Master bedroom:** King sized bed
- **Second bedroom:** Two single beds on the lower level with a third single bed on the mezzanine level above. Serious family negotiating often takes place when deciding who will sleep up-top!

### Bathroom

The large Victorian style bathroom has a massive vintage cast iron bath and a wet room type shower. Bespoke leaded and stained glass windows, made by a local craftsman, add to the individuality of this cottage.

### Character

Traces of Kingfisher Cottage's former use as the farm stables remain throughout. The harness hangers are still set into the walls and the original polished oak tack cupboard makes a wonderful wardrobe!
