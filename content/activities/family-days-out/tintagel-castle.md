## Tintagel Castle

The dramatic ruins of Tintagel Castle sit on a rocky headland connected to the mainland by a modern footbridge. Managed by English Heritage, the site is steeped in the legend of King Arthur and Merlin -- a story that captivates children as much as the scenery. The footbridge itself is impressive, spanning a deep chasm with waves crashing below.

Explore the ruins on the headland, descend to Merlin's Cave on the beach at low tide, and look for the bronze Gallos statue on the clifftop. The coastal views are stunning. Be aware that access involves a steep climb with many steps, so it is not suitable for pushchairs and can be tiring for very young children. Allow 2-3 hours.
