## Lydford Gorge

**Distance:** 3 miles | **Type:** Circular

A spectacular circular walk through the deepest gorge in the South West, featuring the 30-metre White Lady waterfall and the thundering Devil's Cauldron whirlpool. Managed by the National Trust.

### Route Overview

Lydford Gorge sits on the western edge of Dartmoor, where the River Lyd has carved a dramatic, oak-wooded ravine over thousands of years. The full circular walk follows the river through the gorge, passing the Devil's Cauldron at one end, a series of potholes carved into the rock by the swirling water, and the stunning White Lady waterfall at the other. It is one of the most memorable short walks in Devon.

### Highlights

- The White Lady waterfall, a 30-metre cascade tumbling into a mossy plunge pool
- The Devil's Cauldron, a powerful whirlpool where the river surges through a narrow gap in the rock
- Ancient oak woodland draped in ferns, mosses and lichens
- Wildflowers including bluebells in spring and wood anemone
- Birdlife including dippers, grey wagtails and woodpeckers along the river
- The pretty village of Lydford with its medieval castle and Saxon town heritage

### Route Details

**Starting Point:** Lydford Gorge National Trust car park, Lydford, near Okehampton (EX20 4BH)
**Terrain:** Steep, uneven and often slippery woodland paths with steps and boardwalks. Sturdy footwear essential.
**Estimated Time:** 2 to 2.5 hours
**Difficulty:** Moderate. The paths can be steep and slippery, particularly after rain. Not suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs.
**Seasonal Note:** The full circular gorge walk is open from approximately mid-March to early November. In winter, only the waterfall entrance is open for a shorter out-and-back walk to the White Lady. Check the National Trust website for current opening times.

### What to Bring

- Sturdy walking boots with good grip (paths are rocky and often wet)
- Waterproof jacket, as the gorge can be damp even on dry days
- Layers, as the gorge floor is noticeably cooler than the surrounding countryside
- Water and snacks, though there is a tea room at the main entrance
- Camera for the waterfall and woodland scenery

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Head east through Launceston, then take the A30 toward Okehampton. Turn off at the Lydford junction and follow signs to Lydford Gorge. The drive takes around 35 minutes (approximately 20 miles). National Trust members enter free; non-members pay an admission fee at the entrance.
