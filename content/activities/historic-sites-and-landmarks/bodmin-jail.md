## Bodmin Jail

Originally built in 1779 by prisoners of war, Bodmin Jail was one of the first British prisons built to the principles of prison reform. It held inmates for nearly 150 years and was the site of over 50 public executions. The jail has been restored as a museum and visitor attraction, with exhibits exploring the building's grim history, the stories of individual prisoners, and the wider social history of crime and punishment in Cornwall.

The attraction includes both the original ruined wings and a modern museum with interactive displays. There is also a hotel and restaurant within the restored parts of the complex. Allow at least a couple of hours for a visit.
