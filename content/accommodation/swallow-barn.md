## Welcome to Swallow Barn

Swallow Barn is a delightful cottage situated close enough to the sand pit play area for parents to take their cups of coffee with them while they watch their children having fun in the sand. An entrance lobby is useful for stowing sandy shoes, beach gear or wellies.

The cottage has a cosy atmosphere with soft rugs on the wood and slate floors, comfortable sofas and a mixture of rustic and modern styles gives the best of both worlds. Large glazed windows and doors allow the light to pour into the living room and there is seating outside for a quiet glass of something cool in the evening sun. As with all our cottages, the kitchen is well equipped for all your holiday needs.

Upstairs the original beams add extra character and a bird nesting box with a viewing panel is set into the wall behind the curtains.
