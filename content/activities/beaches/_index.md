## Beaches

Cornwall's stunning coastline is one of its greatest attractions, and Waterloo Farm is well placed for exploring a wonderful variety of beaches along the North Cornwall and North Devon coast. From the dramatic cliffs of Crackington Haven just 12 miles away to the wide sandy surf beaches around Bude and beyond, you'll find a beach to suit every mood and every member of the family.
