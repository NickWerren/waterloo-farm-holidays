## Bude - Crooklets Beach

**Distance:** 30 minutes (15 miles) | **Level:** Intermediate | **Type:** Sandy Beach Break

A more exposed alternative to neighbouring Summerleaze, with punchy waves and the famous Bude Sea Pool just around the corner.

### Beach Overview

Crooklets Beach sits on the north side of Bude, separated from Summerleaze by a rocky headland. It picks up more swell than its sheltered neighbour, which means bigger, more powerful waves -- better suited to surfers with some experience. The beach is rocky at low tide but opens up to a wide sandy stretch from mid tide onwards. It hosts regular surf competitions and has a strong local surf community.

### Surf Conditions

- **Best Tide:** Mid to high tide (rocky and exposed at low)
- **Swell Direction:** W to NW
- **Wave Type:** Punchy beach breaks, can be hollow
- **Bottom:** Sand over rock (avoid low tide)
- **Crowding:** Moderate; locals and visiting surfers

### Facilities

- **Parking:** Pay & display car park at Crooklets
- **Lifeguards:** RNLI lifeguards May to September
- **Surf Hire:** Available in Bude town centre
- **Toilets:** Yes, at the car park
- **Nearby:** Bude Sea Pool (free, saltwater, open year-round)

### Best For

- **Intermediates:** More powerful waves than Summerleaze
- **Progressing Surfers:** A good step up from beginner beaches
- **Sea Pool Fans:** Combine a surf with a swim in the famous tidal pool

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Take the A395 to the A39, then follow signs into Bude. Crooklets Beach is signposted on the north side of town. Around 30 minutes.

**A great option when you want something with a bit more push than the gentler beginner beaches. Time your session for mid tide and you will find quality waves with a sandy landing.**
