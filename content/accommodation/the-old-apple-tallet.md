## Welcome to The Old Apple Tallet

Next door to Swallow Barn, The Old Apple Tallet is cosy and welcoming. When you kick off your sandy shoes in the porch and go inside you will find a woodburner in an inglenook fireplace, comfortable sofas and lots of other unusual added features, including a bird nesting box hidden behind the curtains in the bedroom wall and a decorative old cast iron range, happily no longer used for cooking! The kitchen equipment will provide for all your culinary needs for cooking with gas.

The second floor was once the farm's apple loft, or tallet, with characterful beams and cute little windows.
