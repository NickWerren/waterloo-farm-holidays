## Trebah Garden

A spectacular 26-acre subtropical ravine garden that tumbles down a steep wooded valley to a private beach on the Helford River. Trebah has been planted over nearly 200 years, creating a lush, layered canopy of exotic trees and shrubs that feels more like a jungle than a Cornish valley. Giant gunnera with leaves the size of umbrellas, towering tree ferns, vast hydrangea collections and banks of rhododendrons line the paths as they wind down to the water.

The private beach at the foot of the garden is a real highlight, especially in summer -- a sheltered sandy cove on the Helford estuary where you can paddle and picnic. Children enjoy the garden too, with a fort play area, seasonal trails and plenty of space to explore. The planting ensures there is something in flower throughout the year, though late spring and summer are particularly colourful. Allow two to three hours.
