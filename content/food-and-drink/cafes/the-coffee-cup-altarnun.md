## The Coffee Cup at Altarnun

A welcoming little cafe in the pretty village of Altarnun, just a short drive from Waterloo Farm. Top-rated for its homemade cakes — the peanut butter brownies and bakewell blondies come highly recommended — and excellent coffee. Not a chain, just a friendly independent with a warm welcome. Dog-friendly.

**Location:** Altarnun, Launceston, PL15 7RH

**Specialties:** Homemade cakes and bakes, specialty coffee, warm village atmosphere
