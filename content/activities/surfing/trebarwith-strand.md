## Trebarwith Strand

**Distance:** 35 minutes (20 miles) | **Level:** Intermediate | **Type:** Cove Beach Break

A lesser-known surf spot tucked below dramatic cliffs, offering quality waves at mid tide in a stunning setting.

### Beach Overview

Trebarwith Strand is one of North Cornwall's hidden gems. A narrow lane winds down to a cove framed by towering slate cliffs, and when the tide and swell line up, it produces surprisingly good waves. The beach is largely covered at high tide and rocky at low, so the surf window is focused around mid tide. It is quieter than the more popular beaches, which is part of its appeal.

### Surf Conditions

- **Best Tide:** Mid tide (essential -- beach disappears at high, rocky at low)
- **Swell Direction:** W to NW
- **Wave Type:** Punchy peaks over sand and rock
- **Bottom:** Sand with rocky sections
- **Crowding:** Rarely busy; a locals' favourite

### Facilities

- **Parking:** Small car park at the top of the lane (fills quickly in summer)
- **Lifeguards:** Seasonal, limited coverage
- **Surf Hire:** None on site -- bring your own
- **Toilets:** Yes, near the car park
- **Cafe:** The Port William pub overlooks the beach

### Best For

- **Intermediates:** Rewarding waves in a quieter setting
- **Scenery Lovers:** One of the most dramatic beach settings in Cornwall
- **Escaping the Crowds:** Far fewer people than Polzeath or Bude

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Take the A395 to the A39 towards Camelford, then follow signs through Delabole to Trebarwith Strand. The final lane down to the beach is narrow and steep. Around 35 minutes.

**Worth the winding drive for surfers who enjoy quieter line-ups and dramatic scenery. Check the tide times carefully and aim for mid tide to make the most of it.**
