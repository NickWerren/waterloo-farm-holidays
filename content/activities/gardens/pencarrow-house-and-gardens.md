## Pencarrow House & Gardens

A beautiful Georgian mansion set in 50 acres of formal and woodland gardens between Bodmin and Wadebridge. Pencarrow has been home to the Molesworth-St Aubyn family since the Elizabethan era and retains a welcoming, lived-in feel quite different from the larger National Trust properties. The house itself is worth visiting, with fine paintings, furniture and family memorabilia, but the gardens are the real draw.

The mile-long carriage drive is lined with a magnificent collection of specimen conifers, many planted in the 1840s. The formal gardens include a renowned camellia collection, an Italian garden, and a striking blue hydrangea drive that is at its best in summer. Beyond the formal areas, woodland walks lead through peaceful ancient woodland. Pencarrow is rarely crowded, making it a relaxed and enjoyable visit. Opening is seasonal, so check before visiting. Allow two to three hours.
