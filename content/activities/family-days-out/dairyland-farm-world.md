## Dairyland Farm World

A working farm attraction near Newquay where children can watch the cows being milked in the viewing parlour, meet farmyard animals and explore nature trails through the surrounding countryside. The Heritage Centre explains Cornwall's farming history, and the Bull Pen indoor play area gives younger children somewhere to burn off energy.

There are also go-karts, a play area and pony rides in season. The pace is relaxed and the setting is genuinely rural. A good half-day visit, and easy to combine with a trip to one of the north coast beaches nearby.

**Location:** Tresillian Barton, near Newquay -- approximately 30 miles from Waterloo Farm
**Parking:** Free on-site parking
**Cost:** Paid admission; under 2s free
**Best for:** Young children, farm experiences, combining with a beach day
