## Crackington Haven

**Distance:** 25 minutes (12 miles) | **Type:** Rocky Cove with Sand at Low Tide

Our nearest beach - a dramatic cove set beneath some of the highest cliffs in Cornwall, forming part of the Heritage Coast.

### Beach Overview

Crackington Haven sits at the foot of a steep-sided valley where a stream meets the sea, flanked by towering cliffs that rise to over 400 feet. At low tide, a stretch of sand is revealed among the rocks, but this is primarily a rugged, rocky cove rather than a traditional sandy beach. The setting is spectacular, and the area is popular with walkers, rockpoolers and photographers drawn to the dramatic coastal scenery.

### Facilities

- **Parking:** Small pay & display car park (fills quickly in summer)
- **Lifeguards:** Not lifeguarded
- **Toilets:** Yes, at the car park
- **Cafe:** Small seasonal cafe near the car park

### Best For

- **Rockpooling:** Excellent rock pools at low tide, full of crabs, anemones and small fish
- **Coastal Walks:** Outstanding National Trust clifftop walks in both directions along the South West Coast Path
- **Scenery:** Some of the most dramatic cliff formations on the North Cornwall coast
- **Quiet Days Out:** Less busy than the larger Bude beaches

### Getting There

From Waterloo Farm: Head north on the B3254 through North Petherwin, then follow signs to Crackington Haven via the B3263. Around 25 minutes through quiet country lanes.
